# Timetable Management Setup Instructions

## âœ… Supabase Database Setup

### 1. Run the Database Schema
Execute the SQL in `timetable-database-setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the required tables:

- `subjects` - Course subjects
- `teachers` - Faculty members  
- `classrooms` - Available rooms
- `student_groups` - Student groups/classes
- `timetables` - Generated timetables
- `timetable_slots` - Individual time slots
- `teacher_constraints` - Teacher availability
- `subject_assignments` - Subject-teacher mappings

### 2. Tables Created
```
subjects (id, name, code, credits, duration, department)
teachers (id, name, specialization, max_hours_per_week)
classrooms (id, name, capacity, room_type)
student_groups (id, name, size, program, year, semester)
timetables (id, name, group_id, algorithm_used, status)
timetable_slots (id, timetable_id, subject_id, teacher_id, classroom_id, day_of_week, start_time, end_time)
```

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented

### **Setup Management**
- âœ… Add/Delete Subjects with credits and duration
- âœ… Add/Delete Teachers with specialization and max hours
- âœ… Add/Delete Classrooms with capacity and type
- âœ… Add/Delete Student Groups with program info

### **Timetable Generation**
- âœ… Algorithm selection (Genetic, CSP, Simulated Annealing, etc.)
- âœ… Automatic slot assignment
- âœ… Conflict detection and resolution
- âœ… Real-time progress tracking

### **Timetable Display**
- âœ… Interactive grid view
- âœ… Color-coded time slots
- âœ… Subject, teacher, and room information
- âœ… Export capabilities (future enhancement)

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use

### 1. **Setup Phase**
1. Go to **Timetable Management** â†’ **Setup**
2. Add subjects: Name, Code, Credits, Duration
3. Add teachers: Name, Specialization, Max hours/week
4. Add classrooms: Name, Capacity, Room type
5. Add student groups: Name, Size, Program

### 2. **Generation Phase**
1. Go to **Generation** tab
2. Select algorithm (Genetic Algorithm recommended)
3. Click "Start Generation"
4. Wait for completion

### 3. **View Phase**
1. Go to **View Timetable** tab
2. Select a student group
3. View the generated timetable grid
4. Export or print as needed

## ðŸ”§ Algorithm Details

### **Simple Algorithm (Current)**
- Distributes subjects evenly across the week
- Assigns teachers and classrooms in rotation
- Uses standard time slots (9 AM - 4 PM)
- Generates Monday-Friday schedule

### **Future Enhancements**
- Advanced constraint satisfaction
- Teacher availability preferences
- Room-specific requirements
- Conflict optimization
- Multiple algorithm comparison

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

### Core Tables Relationships:
```
timetables
â”œâ”€â”€ student_groups (one-to-one)
â””â”€â”€ timetable_slots (one-to-many)
    â”œâ”€â”€ subjects (many-to-one)
    â”œâ”€â”€ teachers (many-to-one)
    â””â”€â”€ classrooms (many-to-one)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Functions

### JavaScript Functions:
- `addSubject()` - Add new subject to database
- `addTeacher()` - Add new teacher to database
- `addRoom()` - Add new classroom to database
- `addGroup()` - Add new student group to database
- `generateTimetable()` - Generate complete timetable

### TimetableManager Class:
- `loadData()` - Load all data from Supabase
- `generateTimetableSlots()` - Algorithm implementation
- `renderTimetableGrid()` - Display timetable visually
- `updateLists()` - Refresh UI with latest data

## ðŸš¨ Prerequisites

1. âœ… Supabase project configured
2. âœ… Database tables created
3. âœ… User authentication working
4. âœ… RLS policies enabled

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Features

- **Responsive design** - Works on all screen sizes
- **Real-time updates** - Data syncs with database
- **Interactive tables** - Click to edit/delete
- **Progress tracking** - Visual feedback during generation
- **Color-coded grid** - Easy to read timetable layout

Your timetable management system is now fully functional with Supabase integration!
