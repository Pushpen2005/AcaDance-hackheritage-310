# QR Code Library Fix Summary

## Problem
Error: "Failed to start camera: Html5Qrcode is not defined"

## Root Cause
The Html5Qrcode library was not properly loaded in some pages, causing the QR scanning functionality to fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. ✅ Added Html5Qrcode Library to home.html
Updated the script loading section in `home.html` to include the Html5Qrcode library:

```html
<!-- QR Code Libraries -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/html5-qrcode@2.3.8/minified/html5-qrcode.min.js"></script>
```

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Error Checking in qr-scanner.html
Added proper library availability checks:

- **Before starting camera**: Check if `Html5Qrcode` is defined
- **On page load**: Verify library loaded and show user-friendly error if not
- **Better error messages**: Clear indication of what went wrong and how to fix it

### 3. ✅ Created Test Page
Created `qr-library-test.html` to verify:
- Library loading status
- Camera access functionality
- QR code generation
- End-to-end QR workflow

## Files Modified

1. **home.html** - Added Html5Qrcode library script tag
2. **qr-scanner.html** - Added library checks and improved error handling
