# HH310 Project Final Status Report

## Current Status: ✅ ALL MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **"toggleAuthDropdown is not defined" error**
   - **Root Cause**: Function was defined after it was called in onclick handlers
   - **Solution**: Moved all critical functions (toggleAuthDropdown, closeAuthDropdown, closeModal, switchTab, redirectToLogin) to the top of the script section
   - **Verification**: Function is now properly defined before use

2. ✅ **"Refused to apply style from 'style.css'" MIME type error**
   - **Root Cause**: Reference to non-existent style.css file
   - **Solution**: Removed the erroneous link tag, all styles are now embedded in home.html
   - **Verification**: No external CSS dependencies remain
