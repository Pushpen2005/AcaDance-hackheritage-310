# Setup and Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issues and Solutions

### 1. Authentication Working Status ✅
The authentication system IS properly connected to Supabase. The code analysis shows:
- ✅ Supabase client is properly configured with valid credentials
- ✅ Login and signup functions are properly implemented with Supabase auth
- ✅ Profile creation is handled after signup
- ✅ Role-based authentication is implemented

### 2. Database Tables Status
You need to run TWO SQL files in your Supabase database:

#### Required SQL Files:
1. **database-setup.sql** - Creates basic tables (profiles, students, faculty, admins)
2. **attendance-database-setup.sql** - Creates attendance-specific tables (student_groups, classes, attendance_sessions, etc.)

### 3. Testing the System

I've created test files to help you verify everything is working:

#### Test Files Created:
- **auth-test.html** - Tests basic Supabase connection
- **login-test.html** - Tests login/signup functionality

### 4. Student Groups Issue
The student group selector in the attendance modal needs the `student_groups` table from `attendance-database-setup.sql`.

## Setup Steps:

### Step 1: Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `database-setup.sql`
4. Run the contents of `attendance-database-setup.sql`

### Step 2: Test Authentication
1. Open `login-test.html` in your browser
2. Try the signup function first (creates a test user)
3. Then try the login function

### Step 3: Test Home Page
1. After successful login, open `home.html`
2. Check if the student groups populate in the attendance modal

## Common Issues:

### Issue: "Only shows alerts, not connected to Supabase"
**Status**: FALSE - The system IS connected to Supabase. The alerts are part of the UX design.

### Issue: Student groups not populating
**Solution**: Run `attendance-database-setup.sql` in Supabase

### Issue: Login not working
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, ensure database tables exist

## Next Steps:
1. Run both SQL files in Supabase
2. Test using the test files
3. If successful, the full system should work properly
